## Use Cases

- Employers evaluating frontend developer skills
- Frontend developers seeking practice with coding challenges.

## Getting Started

Let's say you want to work on the traffic light challenge.

You can create a new project or use our CLI tool to use the starter template.

### First Time Setup
```bash
# Clone repository and setup CLI tool (only needed once)
git clone https://github.com/elfajriharsuda/frontend-challenges.git

cd frontend-challenges/challenge-cli

npm install

npm link
```

### Start Working
```bash
# Navigate to the root of the repository
cd ..

# Create new project from template (run it at the root of the repository)
challenge-cli start "traffic-light"

# Navigate to project and start development
cd problems/traffic-light/solutions/my-solution

npm run dev
```

> [!NOTE]
> The starter template includes React and necessary tooling to get you started quickly.

## How to Check if Your Solution (UI) Is Accessible

You can use automated accessibility checkers like **axe-core** to detect most accessibility issues.

For more information, check out [this article](https://larsmagnus.co/blog/how-to-test-for-accessibility-with-axe-core-in-next-js-and-react).

Also :

- Test your app with a keyboard to ensure full keyboard navigation
- Add ARIA labels to make your app understandable by screen readers
- Use [Claude](https://claude.ai/new) for a final accessibility check

> [!NOTE]  
> axe-core is already included in the starter template.

## How can you help?

- ‚≠êÔ∏è Star this repository to motivate the addition of more challenges
- ü§ì Solved an interesting problem? Feel free to submit it!
- üêû If you find a bug, raise an issue or fix it and send a pull request.
- üìö Improve documentation or add tutorials for solving challenges.

## How To Add Your Solution

To add your solution follow the process for [making a pull request to an open-source project](https://github.com/gabrieldemarmiesse/getting_started_open_source).

In short:

- Fork this repo and clone it.
- Create a branch and make your change.
- Push your branch to your fork.
- Open a PR against this repo.

## How To Add New Problem

If you wanna work with React, you can use the starter template.

if you can create a new problem, use the create command:

```bash
challenge-cli create new-problem
```

## Coding Standards

Please adhere to the following coding standards when submitting solutions:

- Ensure your app is accessible. Refer to the [Accessibility Guidelines](#how-to-check-if-your-solution-ui-is-accessible) for more details.
- Format your code using Prettier.
